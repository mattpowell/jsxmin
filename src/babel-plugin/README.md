# babel-plugin-jsxmin
> `jsxmin` allows you to write JSX and transpile it to plain, vanilla javascript without React or any other runtime libraries.

This is the Babel plugin that does the heavy lifting for `jsxmin`. You can either reference this plugin directly in your Babel configuration, use on of the integrations in the main repo, or call `jsxmin`'s api directly.

More documentation will be added here; however, please see [`jsxmin`](../../README.md) for additional context.
